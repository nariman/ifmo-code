Completely all source code, written by me while at ITMO University, except some project's sources.  
It's not an "open-source project", that means code style sometimes leaves a lot to be desired, but I did my best.

### For ITMO students

If you're here for my code of labs/homework: [NO GOD!](https://youtu.be/umDr0mPuyQc) PLEASE NO! [NOOOOO!!!](https://youtu.be/Eal4fep7pK4)  
Do not copy-paste! Review it and write your own! It's better for you.  
Thanks.

Sometimes you can find some submodules (remote repositories). It's worth paying attention to them, because they're contains initial sources, statements or other useful things.

### FAQ

#### I need a statement for problem X...
I didn't attach statements due to most of them are typical, or you can guess the initial statement by source code.
But feel free to create a new issue w/ a ref. to the problem. I'll provide you a link to the problem set PDF, or describe it myself.

#### Monolithic repository?!?
Yep.
* It's easier to maintain in this case
* It's harder to copy-paste multiple files at once 😈
* It's easy to merge w/ a Google Drive repository, where my other edu-related documents are located
