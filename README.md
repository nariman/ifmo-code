Completely all source code, written by me while at ITMO University, except some project's sources.  
It's not an "open-source project", that means code style sometimes leaves a lot to be desired, but I did my best.

### For ITMO students

If you're here for my code of labs/homework: [NO GOD!](https://youtu.be/umDr0mPuyQc) PLEASE NO! [NOOOOO!!!](https://youtu.be/Eal4fep7pK4)  
Do not copy-paste! Review it and write your own! It's better for you.  
Thanks.

### Repository structure

Sources, that belongs to the discipline of the current term, not merged to the master branch.  
See topic branches for latest changes.

Disciplines:
* *CT* **[algorithms](algorithms/ct)** - Algorithms and Data Structures - *1-3 term*
* *IS* **[algorithms](algorithms/is)** - Algorithms and Data Structures (only some of labs) - *5-6 term*
* *CT* **[android](android/)** - Android - *3 term*
* *CT* **[cpp](cpp/)** - C/C++ language - *2 term*
* *CT* **[discrete-math](discrete-math/)** - Discrete math - *1-3 term*

* *IS* **[programming-technologies](programming-technologies/)** - Programming technologies - *6 term*
* *IS* **[web](web/)** - Web programming - *5 term*

Sometimes you can find some submodules (remote repositories). It's worth paying attention to them, because they're contains initial sources, statements or other useful things.

### Mini FAQ

#### I need a statement for problem X...
I didn't attach statements due to most of them are typical, or you can guess the initial statement by source code.
But feel free to create a new issue w/ a ref. to the problem. I'll provide you a link to the problem set PDF, or describe it myself.

#### Monolithic repository?!?
Yep.
* It's easier to maintain in this case
* It's harder to copy-paste multiple files at once ðŸ˜ˆ
* It's easy to merge w/ a Google Drive repository, where my other edu-related documents are located

#### Where I can find your boilerplate code for labs?
For Kotlin template - [here](https://gist.github.com/nariman/ff7e8cd7ededa9ad77c8ed28dbb3bb15).  
For Java template (slightly outdated, compared to the Kotlin template) - [here](https://gist.github.com/nariman/113d9b9d60e6678eb8602774f20070e6).
